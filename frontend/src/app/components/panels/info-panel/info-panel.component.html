      This app was created to track Norwegian vessels. On the map there are circles in different colors
      which represent numbers of vessels in this region:
    </p>
    <ul class="map-colors">
      <li class="map-colors__purple"><strong>purple</strong> - 1-5 vessels</li>
      <li class="map-colors__red"><strong>red</strong> - 6-10 vessels</li>
      <li class="map-colors__yellow"><strong>yellow</strong> - 11-20 vessels</li>
      <li class="map-colors__blue"><strong>blue</strong> - above 20 vessels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      At closed range vessels are treated separately (not in groups). This allows to check if the
      actual vessel position was registered earlier than 5 minutes ago (it is marked as
      <span style="color: grey; font-weight: bold;">grey circle</span>, otherwise is
      <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">green circle</span>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Logged user can add single vessels to track them individually <strong>to have history of their positions</strong>
      while they was being tracked. There is also possibility to suspend tracking, resume it or even remove
      all history about vessel positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the map tracked vessels are marked as <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">blue polylines</span>
      with circles on current positions. If tracking is suspended then color of
      <span style="color: grey; font-weight: bold">polyline is grey</span>. Suspended tracking means that application
      will not record positions of this vessel. If tracking is resumed then polyline since suspension to renewal
      will be <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">red and dashed</span>.
